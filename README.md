# LabVIEW-
LabVIEW is a graphical programming environment engineers use to develop automated research, validation, and production test systems. LabVIEW has what you need to build automated test systems, fast. LabVIEW reduces setup time with a visual representation of your NI hardware that helps you quickly validate hardware configuration and view measurements. You can also integrate third-party devices into your application with access to tens of thousands of drivers that typically include APIs, examples, and documentation. LabVIEW removes inefficiencies of repeating manual measurements with a graphical programming approach that enables automation without the burden of traditional programming. Designed for engineers and scientists, the graphical approach maps your thoughts to functional code to meet application needs.
